Hi, how are you doing?
I'm fine. How about yourself?
I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking.
No problem. So how have you been?
I've been great. What about you?
I've been good. I'm in school right now.
What school do you go to?
I go to PCC.
Do you like it there?
It's okay. It's a really big campus.
Good luck with school.
Thank you very much.
How's it going?
I'm doing well. How about you?
Never better, thanks.
So how have you been lately?
I've actually been pretty good. You?
I'm actually in school right now.
Which school do you attend?
I'm attending PCC right now.
Are you enjoying it there?
It's not bad. There are a lot of people there.
Good luck with that.
Thanks.
How are you doing today?
I'm doing great. What about you?
I'm absolutely lovely, thank you.
Everything's been good with you?
I haven't been better. How about yourself?
I started school recently.
Where are you going to school?
I'm going to PCC.
How do you like it so far?
I like it so far. My classes are pretty good right now.
I wish you luck.
Thanks a lot.
It's an ugly day today.
I know. I think it may rain.
It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
That would be weird.
Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
Yes, it would be.
I really wish it wasn't so hot every day.
Me too. I can't wait until winter.
I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather be cold than hot.
Me too.
It doesn't look very nice outside today.
You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
That wouldn't seem right.
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.
I know, you're absolutely right.
I wish it would cool off one day.
That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.
I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot.
That's exactly how I feel.
I wish it was a nicer day today.
That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
Any rain right now would be pointless.
That's right, it really would be.
I want it to cool down some.
I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.
Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
I feel the same way.
Hello, may I speak to Alice please?
This is she. How's it going?
I've been trying to call you all day.
Sorry about that. I was cleaning up.
It's okay.
So what were you calling me about?
Oh, I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow.
Sure, what did you want to do?
Maybe we can go see a movie or something.
That sounds like fun. Let's do it.
I'll see you tomorrow then.
See you then. Goodbye.
Hi, how are you. Is Alice there?
Speaking. What's up?
Why haven't you answered the phone?
My bad, I had chores to do.
That's all right.
What was the reason for your call?
I want to do something tomorrow with you.
Sounds good. What did you have in mind?
I was thinking about seeing a movie.
Okay, let's go see a movie.
Until then.
Talk to you later.
Is Alice available?
You're talking to her.
I've called you a hundred times today.
I was busy doing something. I apologize.
No problem.
Did you need something?
Do you want to do something tomorrow?
Is there somewhere special you wanted to go?
How about a movie?
A movie sounds good.
Call me tomorrow then.
I will see you tomorrow.
Have you seen the new girl in school?
No, I haven't.
She's really pretty.
Describe her to me.
She's not too tall.
Well, how tall is she?
She's about five feet even.
What does she look like, though?
She has pretty light brown eyes.
I may know which girl you're talking about.
So you have seen her around?
Yes, I have.
There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?
I haven't seen her yet.
I think that she is very pretty.
Tell me how she looks.
She's kind of short.
What height is she?
She's probably about five feet.
That's nice, but tell me what she looks like.
The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.
I think I might've bumped into her before.
Are you telling me that you've seen her before?
I believe so.
Have you met the new girl?
No. Have you?
She's one of the prettiest girls at the school.
What does she look like?
Well, she's quite short.
How tall would you say that she is?
I would say she's only five feet.
What about her facial features?
She has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Have you seen her?
I think that I have.
